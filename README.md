# Internet Café

A small internet café in a village just outside of Manilla has 8 computers, which are available on a first-come first-serve basis. When all the computers are taken, the next person in line has to wait until a computer frees up.

This morning several groups of tourists, 25 people in all, are waiting when the doors open.

Each person spends between 15 minutes and 2 hours online.

Write a program to simulate the computer usage at the café

## Notes

Use `time.Sleep()` to simulate delays and activities.

Remember to seed math/rand so that people’s activities (eating morsels and putting on shoes) take different amounts of time each time you run the code.

The exercises were inspired by William Kennedy’s post [The Nature Of Channels In Go](http://www.goinggo.net/2014/02/the-nature-of-channels-in-go.html).
